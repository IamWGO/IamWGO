# Waleerat S. Gottlieb
## iOS & Android Developer, Future DepOps

In May 2022, I achieved one of my biggest career goals by landing my dream job as a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMM) developer at iCura ApS in Denmark. As part of my role, I have the opportunity to build mobile applications using both SwiftUI and Kotlin, allowing me to learn and utilize two different languages while also mastering how to code shared logic between them.

I am passionate about mobile application development and excited to continue growing as a Native App developer. I am confident that my strong technical skills, commitment to quality, excellent communication abilities, and eagerness to learn will undoubtedly make me a valuable asset to any team.
